# Abstract
Deep fake technology, particularly face-swapped videos, poses significant risks, including political misinformation, fraud, and character defamation. With advancements in AI and generative models, detecting these manipulations has become increasingly challenging. This project aims to develop an AI/ML-based forensic technique to authenticate face-swapped deep fake videos by analyzing various digital artifacts. The system will assess input videos using advanced detection methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), frequency analysis, and biometric verification. It will identify inconsistencies in facial features, temporal sequences, and audio-visual synchronization. The output will provide a comprehensive forensic report, confirming whether the video is real or fake, highlighting abnormalities, and explaining potential deep fake creation techniques. By integrating multiple detection techniques, the system aims to improve accuracy and robustness in deep fake identification.
