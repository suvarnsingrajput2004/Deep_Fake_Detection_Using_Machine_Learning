🗓️ Log Book: Deep Fake Detection (Work in Progress)
Duration: 5 Feb 2025 – 21 Apr 2025
Status: Ongoing Development

✅ 5 – 10 Feb 2025
📌 Project Initialization

Defined project scope: DeepFake detection using machine learning.

Explored recent research papers and GitHub repos for references.

Created the initial Jupyter notebook and set up a virtual environment.

✅ 11 – 17 Feb 2025
📁 Dataset Exploration

Reviewed datasets: FaceForensics++, DFDC, Celeb-DF.

Downloaded partial data from FaceForensics++ for testing.

Began writing preprocessing scripts (frame extraction and resizing).

✅ 18 – 24 Feb 2025
🧪 Basic Model Setup

Implemented a basic CNN to test feasibility on static image frames.

Trained initial model on limited data; accuracy not satisfactory.

Identified need for better preprocessing and larger data split.

✅ 25 Feb – 2 Mar 2025
🔄 Preprocessing Improvements

Wrote scripts to automate frame extraction from videos.

Applied face detection and alignment on extracted frames.

Started annotating samples for better ground truth consistency.

✅ 3 – 10 Mar 2025
🧠 Model Experimentation (Still Testing)

Experimented with ResNet and MobileNet for feature extraction.

Implemented augmentation (flipping, brightness, blur).

Results vary; models overfitting due to small data size.

✅ 11 – 18 Mar 2025
⚙️ Data Management + Evaluation

Added confusion matrix, classification report.

Logged predictions and started plotting Grad-CAM visualizations.

Still validating outputs; not consistent across all samples.

✅ 19 – 27 Mar 2025
🔍 Model Refinement

Integrated frame-based majority voting logic for video classification.

Explored using LSTM on frame sequence outputs – still in progress.

Evaluated performance on unseen video samples.

✅ 28 Mar – 4 Apr 2025
🛠️ Pipeline Work (Ongoing)

Worked on end-to-end pipeline: video input → frame extraction → detection.

Minor bugs in prediction loop and frame alignment (not fully resolved).

Planning to test newer CNN + LSTM structure.

✅ 5 – 12 Apr 2025
🧪 Debugging + Feature Improvements

Fine-tuned frame prediction thresholds.

Began restructuring code for modular execution.

Started documenting functions for reproducibility.

✅ 13 – 21 Apr 2025
🧾 Work in Progress

LSTM-based architecture not yet finalized.

Model accuracy still unstable on long/low-quality videos.

Planning to explore 3D CNNs or Transformers in upcoming weeks.

Finalizing experiment logs and preparing mid-progress presentation.

🔄 Next Steps (Post 21 April):

Expand training on full FaceForensics++ dataset.

Finalize model architecture (consider 3D CNNs or ViTs).

Build and deploy minimal web interface.

Performance benchmarking and report writing.
